You can also use `weights=ResNet18_Weights.DEFAULT` to get the most up-to-date weights.\n","  warnings.warn(msg)\n","Loading model from: /content/drive/MyDrive/UNSW/FairPrune/Outputs/Resnet18_checkpoint_BASE.pth\n","+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Pruning Iteration 0 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n","{'train': 8854, 'val': 2209}\n","{'train': 3955, 'val': 994}\n"," 99% 99/100 [00:25<00:00,  3.87it/s]\n","all_saliencies[0].shape:  torch.Size([11178051])\n","average_saliency[0].shape:  torch.Size([11178051])\n","{'Mean': 5.831848284287844e-07, 'Std Deviation': 6.416213727789e-05, 'Minimum Value': -0.002921599429100752, 'Maximum Value': 0.10496893525123596}\n"," --------------------------- Pruning Verification ---------------------------\n","\n","Pruned 558780 out of 11173248 parameters\n","\n"," ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","{'train': 12809, 'val': 3203}\n","Traceback (most recent call last):\n","\n","^C\n"]}],"source":["!python FairPrune.py --config Fitz17k_configs.yml"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"fDXv-1MmDg0i"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
